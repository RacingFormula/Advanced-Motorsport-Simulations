# Advanced Motorsport Simulations

This repository organises advanced simulation projects in motorsport. These projects use cutting-edge techniques to simulate and optimise race scenarios and vehicle performance.

## Projects

### 1. [Monte Carlo Race Simulator](https://github.com/RacingFormula/Monte-Carlo-Race-Simulator)
Uses Monte Carlo simulations to evaluate race scenarios and identify optimal strategies.

### 2. [Dynamic Race Simulator](https://github.com/RacingFormula/Dynamic-Race-Simulator)
Simulates dynamic race scenarios, including weather changes and crashes.

### 3. [Bayesian Optimisation Strategy](https://github.com/RacingFormula/Bayesian-Optimisation-Strategy)
Uses Bayesian methods to find the global optimum for race strategies.

### 4. [Stochastic Tyre Degradation Model](https://github.com/RacingFormula/Stochastic-Tyre-Degradation-Model)
Models tyre degradation as a stochastic process to better predict wear variability.

### 5. [Real-Time Strategy Simulator](https://github.com/RacingFormula/Real-Time-Strategy-Simulator)
A prototype for simulating race strategies in real-time during a race.
